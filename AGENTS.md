## Overview

## Authority and placement

> Capsule: Authoritative claims live in source Markdown and goal contracts. SQLite, routers, search

Authoritative claims live in source Markdown and goal contracts. SQLite, routers, search
indexes, receipts, and runtime state are derived projections. Never hand-edit a derived
database, router, receipt, seal, lease, or loop state.

Place durable content by epistemic role: goals in `goals/`, bounded work in `tasks/`,
outcomes in `reports/`, causal failures in `bugs/`, implementation maps in `code/`, source
facts in `research/`, tradeoffs in `decisions/`, stable synthesis in `docs/`, and closed
loop material in `archive/`.

<a id="s-project-initiation-authority"></a>
## Project initiation authority

> Capsule: For a fresh external project, Human intent comes first. A reviewed

For a fresh external project, Human intent comes first. A reviewed
`kairos-project-kickoff/v1` contract establishes the project goal, milestone, task and
criteria before source discovery. The agent then runs `kickstart detect <project>` and
`kickstart init --auto`. Python/JavaScript/TypeScript/Rust/Go/JVM/.NET/Ruby/PHP use bounded
project-local source membership with exact hashes and ledgers; KAIROS does not invent dynamic
imports, runtime reachability or build participation. C/C++/CUDA translation-unit membership
remains compiler-produced and fail-closed, with compiler-guided local-header closure. Mixed
projects combine these authorities without projecting non-C-family files as translation units.

<a id="s-mandatory-context-loop"></a>
## Mandatory context loop

> Capsule: Before a project workspace exists, query the immutable framework corpus with kairos search "<question>" and no --workspace; use it to retrieve the governing KAIROS procedure instead of reconstructing rules from the directory tree. Once proj

Before a project workspace exists, query the immutable framework corpus with `kairos search "<question>"` and no `--workspace`; use it to retrieve the governing KAIROS procedure instead of reconstructing rules from the directory tree. Once project intake exists, project questions use the project workspace.

Orient from the current state and operating contract, ask a concrete question, search the
smallest authoritative sections, chase typed references, perform one bounded action, write
the matching source document, promote it in the same heartbeat, validate the result, and
checkpoint the frontier. A search miss is not proof of absence; inspect the owning source
when the contract requires it.

<a id="s-fail-closed-boundaries"></a>
## Fail-closed boundaries

> Capsule: The harness owns document validation and deterministic promotion. The Workshop is the only

The harness owns document validation and deterministic promotion. Initial intake observes the
original project read-only and may deterministically create the first KAIROS Markdown/database
baseline. After seal, the Workshop is the only writer for governed source, governed build/config
authority and governed Markdown. Humans, agents, editors, watchers, adapters, build tools and copy
utilities do not edit the configured live corpus directly. They may edit only Workshop transaction
candidate/work trees. Any analysis or external tool with plausible write side effects must run on
an isolated clone/snapshot rather than the governed original.

An optional parity adapter is project-supplied and must be explicitly bound. The canonical
package supplies no build command, scientific domain, fixture, runner, or result authority.

<a id="s-change-discipline"></a>
## Change discipline

> Capsule: Keep transactions bounded and preserve exact bytes, hashes, mappings, topology and provenance.

Keep transactions bounded and preserve exact bytes, hashes, mappings, topology and provenance.
Existing governed files use `checkout -> prepare -> verify -> apply`. Create/delete/rename of static-
ecosystem sources use `source-set-checkout -> source-set-prepare -> source-set-verify -> source-set-apply`;
the live project remains unchanged until verified apply. Candidate build/config changes and C-family
topology are refused by that generic source-set path. C-family owner-only header changes remain derived
inside the ordinary transaction; governed-header topology uses the compiler-backed authority migration,
and compiler-context/build-authority changes require stronger project-specific proof. After any failed
command, inspect state before retrying. Do not widen a scope or disable a gate to make a refusal disappear.
Git and remote publication require an explicit, separate approval.
